## Game Pitch

Ana, a devout nun, and Lilith, a mysterious vampire, find their fates intertwined through repeated encounters in a medieval city plagued by a mysterious illness. When a certain ‚Äútruth‚Äù is revealed, Ana must decide how to stop the corruption at its source‚Äîby continuing to serve the church as a nun or becoming an outcast to side with the vampire.

## Play!

The Windows/Mac builds are located in the Builds folder. You can also play it in the editor (using Unity v2022.3.16f1), which may be better, but make sure to set the screen to 800x720.

## Meet the Characters

### Ana (23)
A devout nun from the upper ward. Desperate to prove her worth to the church who looks down on her, she obeys every command without a moment's hesitation. Her daily tasks include the administration of holy water to her patients across the city.

### Lilith (???)
A mysterious vampire from the lower ward. Her identity is only known by the people of the lower ward, who accept her and refute the anti-vampire propaganda spread by the church. She was taken in by the tavern keeper at a young age and has since then used her blood-sucking abilities to drain tainted blood from her patients.
