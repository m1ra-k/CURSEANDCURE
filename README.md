(Please read through this, there's lots of cool lore and features we wanted to show off! :D)

## Game Pitch

Ana, a devout nun, and Lilith, a mysterious vampire, find their fates intertwined through repeated encounters in a medieval city plagued by a mysterious illness. When a certain “truth” is revealed, Ana must decide how to stop the corruption at its source—by continuing to serve the church as a nun or becoming an outcast to side with the vampire.

This is meant to be the first part of the game, specifically named LILITH: Prologue. Chronologically, this part is supposed to be played after (and optionally) ANA: Prologue, but due to the requirements of the project, we decided to implement our game as the prologue of the actual vampire instead. The game's original design was to feature two alternating protagonists (one during the day and the other during night) and a branching narrative, heavily themed around moral philosophy, good and bad, and curse and cure.

## Play!

This game is reminiscent of RPG Maker games, as a lot of our favorite games were made in the engine. For that reason, it follows a similar style in terms of execution.

The Windows/Mac builds are located in the Executables folder. You can also play it in the editor (using Unity v2022.3.16f1), which may be better, but make sure to set the screen to 800x720.

## Meet the Characters

### Ana (23)
A devout nun from the upper ward. Desperate to prove her worth to the church who looks down on her, she obeys every command without a moment's hesitation. Her daily tasks include the administration of holy water to her patients across the city.

### Lilith (???)
A mysterious vampire from the lower ward. Her identity is only known by the people of the lower ward, who accept her and refute the anti-vampire propaganda spread by the church. She was taken in by the tavern keeper at a young age and has since then used her blood-sucking abilities to drain tainted blood from her patients.

## Things You May Have Missed...
--> We *really* wanted to focus on the worldbuilding aspect of the game, so talk to all the characters you see to learn more about the lore of CURSE AND CURE!

--> We did our best to make the dialogue fun and silly (an absolute must). Everyone in the world has at least one dialogue, and different flags are set for more main events (namely patient healing) that make them switch between multiple dialogues. For example, Hilda will say different stuff depending on what part of the story you're at! Always talk!

--> Try stepping on the flowers between the two kids by all the houses! There's a cute interaction. Make sure to talk to them after too.

--> Lilith is in the lower ward... so is it possible to go to the upper ward as well? See what happens when you take the path to the upper ward.

--> There is an optional part after healing the second patient Lilith hints at, where you can check in on Hilda at the tavern. Go see if there's anything new there!

--> Speaking of after the second patient... it goes from evening to night. So a lot of people aren't outside anymore. Where could they be?

--> Wow... bump sound effects when you bump into something! Small details.

--> There's a dancing NPC. She's recurring in a few places too. Try finding her in both!
